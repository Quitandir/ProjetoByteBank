# Projeto ByteBank

## About the project

Project developed on the course "JavaScrpit: Heren√ßa e Polimorfismo", aiming at the creation of a banking system capable of linking clients to different kinds of accounts and their features (deposit, withdraw and transfer), as well as checking login for bank workers.

In order to build this system, the object oriented perpective was chosen, so that different client accounts and bank worker objects could inherit methods and constructs. This way, sensitive data can be protected and used only through the correct instances. 

## Technology

Only JavaScrpit was used to develop the projected, base on the concepts of object orientation and inheritance.

## Experience

Different from other projects developed during the same time frame, it was the first that used only JavaScript. The concept of creating classes and instances of those classes to make specific variations with unique properties and methods helped the understanding of the chosen paradigms. 

Also, to make codes easily readable, it was chosen no make .js files for each class, importing and exporting modules using a package.json.
